# What if there was no version control system?
=> If there was no VCS then we would have to copy/paste the codes or use google drives for code sharing

# Advantages of using version control system (VCS)
=> Tracks the history of your entire codebase
=> It helps to collaborate in a team
=> Maintain the code version

# Version control Systems => git, mercurial, google vcs

# We should also keep our code somewhere in the cloud. It would be if the cloud supports git
# That's why we use GitHub
