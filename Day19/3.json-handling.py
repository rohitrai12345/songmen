# JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation
# JSON is a file format to share data among different entities. For example, it helps in the communication
# between FE and BE, BE and Mobile end, BE and BE
 
# There is also another format for data sharing i.e XML
 
# Example iof JSON is {"name": "Ram", "age": 20, "dob": "2004-02-12", "salary": 2440.12}
# JSON looks alike Python dictionary but there are differences.
# Keys and values of JSON object must be enclosed within double quotes (single not allowed) unless integer or
# float
# JSON objects don't support complex object. They only support string, integers and float
# Unlike python dictionary (which supports all immutable objects as a key), JSON only supports string

    {"name": "Ram", "age": 20},
    {"name": "Ram", "age": 20},
    {"name": "Ram", "age": 20},

# Json can either be in array format or in object format
a = [1, 2, 3]  # This is also a valid JSON
b = [1, "Ram", 2]  # This is also a valid JSOn
 
# Python has a good support for JSON as it has a builtin json module
# Extension for json file is .json
