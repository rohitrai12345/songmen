# Numbers are the immutable datatypes in python
# They can be further classified as integer, float and complex

# Integer
# int() function is a built-in function to create an integer object
# Integers are the number without decimal values

a = int()
b = 2
c = -12


# Float
# float() function is a built-in function to create a float
# Floats are the number with decimal values

a = float()
b = 2.0
c = 3.1
d = 2e3
print(d)  # 2000.0
e = -33.3


# Complex
# They are the number with imaginary values
# complex() function is used to create a complex data

a = 2 + 3j
print(a)  # 2 + 3j

b = 4j

c = 2-3j

d = -5j
e = 2 + 1j
